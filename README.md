# REPO MADE ONLY FOR MY LEARNING AND MY PRACTICING PURPOSES

IDEAS OR WHAT AM I GOING TO DO:

**WE WANT TO SUBSCRINE ON REALTIME CHANGES IN posts TABLE**

BUT WE NEED TO ENABLE REAL-TIME FIRST THROUGH SUPABASE DASBOARD

`Datbase -> Replication -> 0 tabls`

THEN TURN SWITCH FOR posts TABLE

## WE CAN NOW MAKE AN SUBRIPTION

- SPINNING UP POSTGRES INSTANCE WITH A SUPABASE

- LEARNING MORE ABOUT SUPABASE

- BUILDING PROJECT WITH SUPABASE (BLOG APP (FRONTEND WILL USE TAILWIND))

## MAJOR TECHNOOGIES USED IN THIS "TRYOUT":

- Typescript

- Next.js

- next-connect

- PostgreSQL

- SUPABASE

...

# INITIAL SETUP

## BOOTSTRAPED WITH:

```
code pages/index.tsx
```

## DEPENDANCIES (ADD HERE WHEN YOU THINK OF SOME)

`yarn add next-connect cors morgan pg nanoid`

# NOTES (INCLUDING DTABASE SETUP WITH DOCKER)

[SOME NOTES](/__NOTES/)

**NOTES ARE MANLY FOR EXPLAINING HOW TO SPIN UP CONTAINER WITH A POSTGRES INSTANCE AND SOME OTHER STUFF, LIKE CONNECTING TO A DATABASE INSIDE CLUSTER**

# USEFULL POSTGRES LINKS:

# USEFUL SUPABASE TUTORIAL I'M GOING TO FOLLOW

<https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-complete-guide-to-full-stack-development-with-supabas/>

## MAYBE I'LL COVER:

API DESIGN WITH `next-connect` PLUS AUTHENTICATION WITH JWT IN PERN STACK (ONLY TRIED FOR A MOMENT)
