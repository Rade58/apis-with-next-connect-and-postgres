# DEFINING SCHEMAS

SO WE WRITE OUR SCHEMA IN `prisma/schema.prisma`

**AND BY DEFINING OUR SCHEMA, WE ARE REPLACING USAGE OF `SQL` `CREATE TABLE` CLAUSE (TAHAT IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE EXECUTED UNDER THE HOOD IF I CAN SAY THAT) AND SCHEMA SHOULD ALSO GIVE US BETTED DDEV EXPERIANCE WHEN WE USE PRISMA CLIENT FOR QUERIES AND MUTATIONS**

## LETS REMIND OURSELF THAT WE ALREADY USED SQL TO CREATE ONLY TABLE WE HAVE IN OUR DATABASE; `AND I AM ((NOT GOING)) TO EVEN TRY DEFINING posts IN OUR PRISMA SCHEMA`

I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU SQL WE ALREDI EXECUTED IN SUPABASE DASBOARD

```sql
CREATE TABLE posts(
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users NOT NULL,
  user_email TEXT,
  title TEXT,
  content TEXT,
  inserted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc'::TEXT, NOW()) NOT NULL
);


ALTER TABLE posts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Individuals can create posts." ON posts FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Individuals can update their own posts." ON posts FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Individuals can delete their own posts." ON posts FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Post are public." ON posts FOR SELECT USING (true);
```

**ALSO SINCE WE USED SUPABASE AUTH I GUES WE HAVE `users` TABLE IN OUR DATBASE, AND 2WE AREN'T GOING TO TOUCH THAT ALSO**

OK SINCE WE DETERMINED THAT WE ARE `NOT GOING TO TRY MESSING WITH ALREADY CREATED TABLES` WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH OUR SCHEMA

## CREATING MODEL FOR `articles` TABLE AND `persons` TABLE

INSTEAD OF Post WE WILL BUILD MODELS FOR Article AND Persons

LET ME REMIND YOU, WE ARE DOING THIS IN A `prisma/schema.prisma` FILE THAT IS GENERATED FOR US

```
code prisma/schema.prisma
```

```c#
// This is your Prisma schema file,
// learn more about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

// WE ARE ADDING THIS

model Article {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean @default(false)
  author    Person? @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int?
}

// AND THIS

model Person {
  id       Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  name     String?
  email    String?   @unique
  articles Article[] // THIS IS APARENTLY REQUIRED
  // BECAUSE IN Article WE ARE USING FOREGEIN KEY FOR
  // A Person (AND WHEN WE DO THAT WE ALSO NEED TO ENTER
  //        articles Article[]    )


  // THIS I DECIDED TO COMMENT OUT (IT IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT IF WE EVER
  // IN SOME OTHER PROJECT DECIDE TO USE NEXT-AUT)
  // WHICH WILL MAP THIS MODEL TO THE users CREATED BY NEXT-AUTH

  // >> NOTE: You're occasionally using
  // >> `@map`and`@@map`to map some field and model names
  // >> to different column and table names in the underlying database.
  // >> This is because NextAuth.js has some special
  // >> requirements for calling things in your database a certain way.


  // createdAt DateTime @default(now()) @map(name:"created_at")
  // updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt @map(name: "updated_at")

  // @@map(name: "persons")
}
```
