# WE DEFINED SCHEMA IN PREVIOUS BRANCH, NOW LET ORDER PRISMA TO CREATE NEW TABLES, BY USING, MENTIONED SCHEMA

BUT WE HAVE ONE PROBLEM AND THAT IS EFAULT SETTING OF PRISMA THAT ENV VARIABLES ARE ONLY TAKEN FROM .env FILE

**WE PLACED `DATABASE_URL` INSIDE .env.local SO WE NEED TO TELL PRISMA TO LOAD ENV VARIABLE FROM .env.local INSTED**

FOR THAT PURPOSE WE WILL INSTALL [`dotenv-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-cli)

```
npm i -g dotenv-cli
```

**WE NEED TO INCORPORATE `npx prisma db push` IN OUR SCRIPT WHERE WE WILL DEFINE THAT ENV VARIABLES ARE LOADING FROM .env.local**

```
code package.json
```

```json
"scripts": {
    
  "prisma:db:push": "dotenv -e .env.local -- npx prisma db push"
},
```

## LET' EXECUTE `npx prisma db push`

```
yarn prisma:db:push
```

## WHEN WE EXECUTED PUSH COMMAND WE ARE INFORMED THAT:

- DATABASE IS IN SYNC WITH OUR SCHEMA (SO THAT MEANS THAT TABLES ARE CREATED)

- AND WE CAN SEE THAT PRISMA CLIENT IS SPEACIIALLY GENERATED TO FOLLOW SHAPE OF OUR DATASET

**YOU CAN CHECK YOUR DATBASE ON SUPABASE DASBOARD TO SEE IF TABLES ARE CREATED** (EVERYTHING LOOKS OK)

## IN NEXT BRANCH I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO CREATE AND QUERY DUMMY DATA USING `PRISMA STUDIO`
