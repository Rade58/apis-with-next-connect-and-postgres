# WHY I WANT TO 'EXPAND' AUTHENTICATION ITH NEXT AUTH

WHEN I SAID 'EXPAND', I MEAN DEFINING MORE OPTION INSIDE `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts`

FOR EXAMPLLE, **I REALLY DON'T LIKE THAT LOGIN BUTTONS (FOR GITHUB AND GOOGLE) ARE GENERATED ON PAGE SETTED BY NEXT-AUTH**

**I WANT TO SET THAT PAGE BY MYSELF**




# IN NEST BRANCH I WILL SHOW YOU HOW TO DEFINE REDIRECT AFTER SIGNING IN

YOU WILL SET UP CALLBACK FOR NEXT-AUTH, AGAIN (BEFORE WE SETTED CALLBACK WHERE WE DID EXTEND SESSION OBJECT)

THIS IS DOCUMENTATION:
