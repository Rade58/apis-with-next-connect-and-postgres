# DEPLOYMENT AND OAUTH APPS FOR PRODUCTION

LETS START BY MAKING AND TRYING OUT PRODUCTION BUILD

```
yarn build
```

```
yarn start
```

**EVERYTHING SEEMS TO WORK PROPERLY**

## LET'S NOW THINK AHAED OF TIME ABOUT WHAT URL WE ARE GOING TO SET OUR APP ON VERCEL





## LET'S START WITH DEPLOYMENT, JUST TO GET VALID URL

```
vercel
```

IF IT FAILS YOU STILL HAVE PROJECT THAT IS TRIED TO BE DEPLOYED ON VERCEL,**GO THERE AND SET ENV VARIABLES** (AS YOU KNOW YOU AN LOOK THEM UP INSIDE .env.local)

ADD MOST OF THE VARIABLES (THE ONES FOR OAUTH WE WILL ADD LATER)

RUN VERCEL AGAIN

```
vc
```
