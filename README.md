# DEFINING SCHEMAS

SO WE WRITE OUR SCHEMA IN `prisma/schema.prisma`

**AND BY DEFINING OUR SCHEMA, WE ARE REPLACING USAGE OF `SQL` `CREATE TABLE` CLAUSE (TAHAT IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE EXECUTED UNDER THE HOOD IF I CAN SAY THAT) AND SCHEMA SHOULD ALSO GIVE US BETTED DDEV EXPERIANCE WHEN WE USE PRISMA CLIENT FOR QUERIES AND MUTATIONS**

## LETS REMIND OURSELF THAT WE ALREADY USED SQL TO CREATE ONLY TABLE WE HAVE IN OUR DATABASE

I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU THAT QUERY

LET'S REVIEW IT A LITTLE BIT

```sql
CREATE TABLE posts(
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users NOT NULL,
  user_email TEXT,
  title TEXT,
  content TEXT,
  inserted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc'::TEXT, NOW()) NOT NULL
);


ALTER TABLE posts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Individuals can create posts." ON posts FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Individuals can update their own posts." ON posts FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Individuals can delete their own posts." ON posts FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Post are public." ON posts FOR SELECT USING (true);
```
