# GITHUB OAUTH

FIRST LETS OAUTH APPLICATION ON GITHUB

`Settings -> Developer Settings -> OAuth Apps -> New Oauth App -> Register a new application`

MOST IMPORTAN THING IS `Authorization Callback Url` YOU NEED TO PROVIDE

## THIS IS GOING TO BE GITHUB OAUTH ONLY FOR DEVELOPMENT SINCE WE ARE GOING TO SET AUTHORIZATION CALLBACK URL THAT IS TIED TO OUR LOCALHOST WHERE DEVELOPMENT APP IS SERVED

WHEN WE PUSH TO PRODUCTION WE NEED COMPLETELY NEW GITHUB OAUTH APP

AND AS YOU CAN SEE CALLBACK POINTS TO THE /api/auth WHERE WE ARE GOING TO IMPLEMENT NEXT-AUTH
